Testing Linux under emulator

1. build
  1.1 goal: linux setup that runs under qemu
  1.2 known: mini-rv32ima works: risc-v toolchain, buildroot, image runs under qemu
    * fresh build doesn't quite work either, fs not quite right?
  1.3 tries
    1.3.1 modify mini-rv32ima buildroot config to 64bit
      1.3.1.1 it complains about -msoft-float option not recognized when building uclibc
    1.3.2 fresh buildroot build from source
    steps:
      * wsl ubuntu 22.04.3LTS
      * install required pkgs for tool chain
      * git clone https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain
      * mkdir /opt/riscv; chmod a+w /opt/riscv
      * ./configure --prefix=/opt/riscv --enable-multilib
      * make linux
      * git clone git://git.buildroot.net/buildroot
      * git checkout 2023.11
      * make qemu_riscv64_virt_defconfig
      * make menuconfig (remove RISC-V F extension; uclibc; remove network interface;initramfs only; remove host-qemu); remove python, 
      * make linux-menuconfig (sysV IPC, remove all SoCs) 
      * make
      * cd output/images ; ./start-qemu.sh
    config files:
      * buildroot
      * kernel
      * busybox
      * uclibc
    status
      * it runs fine now, but it use OpenSBI, glibc, ext2 fs etc.
      * doesn't run without OpenSBI, just hang w/ -bios none -kernel Image
      * try with initramfs, works now, although qemu was still built
      * 
    issues
      * add OpenSBI option after no selection at first doesn't produce the firmware files
      * can buildroot run without toolchain since it has its own
