Testing Linux under emulator

1. build
  1.1 goal: linux setup that runs under qemu
  1.2 known: mini-rv32ima works: risc-v toolchain, buildroot, image runs under qemu
  1.3 tries
    1.3.1 modify mini-rv32ima buildroot config to 64bit
      1.3.1.1 
    1.3.2 fresh buildroot build from source
      * ubuntu, required pkgs, riscv-gnu-toolchain, buildroot
      * can buildroot run without toolchain since it has its own?
      1.3.2.1 builds but hangs on qemu
      1.3.2.2 does not build
