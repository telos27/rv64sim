Add 64-bit support
	* change all registers and CSRs to 64-bit
	* bit locations of certain CSR fields
	* change internal storage like pc, interrupt to be 64-bit
	* change all instructions to do 64-bit
	* add 32-bit instructions: 
		* register
		* imm 
		* load/store
		* M: trap for most instructions?
		* AMO
	* change Sv32 to Sv39
	* timer -> 64 bits
	** PLIC CSR size and R/W size

Reorganize code
	* cpu
	* SoC
	* simulator/driver
